# DesktopNotifierPython
Desktop Reminder/Notifier coded in python

This script is time based desktop notifier I used as a reminder.

The excel sheet I have used has three column for hour,minute and second to easily use the time in python script. I will modify it in near future to retrieve time directly from single column.

Install following libraries to avoid module errors.

pip3 install plyer

pip3 install pause

below is reference image of sheet I used for testing.
